# Draw CLI Tool – Test Case Repository

This repository contains a complete set of **test cases** for validating the Draw CLI Tool, which converts various diagram formats (Mermaid, MMD, text-based diagrams, etc.) into **Draw.io XML**.

## 📌 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to maintain reliable and consistent test samples that verify:

- Accurate conversion of diagrams into Draw.io XML  
- Correct handling of multiple diagram types  
- Stability across updates and refactors  
- Coverage of edge cases and complex structures  

These test cases are used for **manual testing**, **automated testing**, and **regression checks**.

### **Inputs**
Raw diagram files in Mermaid/MMD/Markdown formats.

### **Outputs**
Expected Draw.io XML results generated by the Draw CLI Tool.

## 🧪 Included Diagram Types

This repository contains test cases for:

- Flowcharts  
- Sequence diagrams  
- ER diagrams  
- Class diagrams  
- Mind maps  
- Git graphs  
- Multi-branch workflows  
- Large complex diagrams  
- Small and medium examples  
- Edge-case diagrams (deep nesting, long labels, branching)  

Each test case includes **one input file** and **one expected XML output**.

---

## ⚙️ How to Use

1. Run the Draw CLI Tool on any file under `/inputs`.
2. Compare the generated XML against the matching file in `/outputs/xml`.
3. If both XML structures match → **Test Passed**.  
4. If not, inspect differences and fix the converter or update the expected XML (if behavior changed intentionally).

This makes regression testing easy and reliable.

## 🤝 Contributing

You can contribute new test cases by adding:

- An input diagram  
- The expected XML output  
- A short description of what the test covers  

Submit a PR and maintainers will review it.
